# 5️⃣ Polymorphism via Inheritance (MOST COMMON)

# Usage
shapes = [Rectangle(), Circle()]

# Output:
# 50
# 78.5

"""
if use print instead of return like print("Animal Has 2 Eyes")
Now x = h.eyes(). Python goes inside eyes(). print("Human Has 2 Eyes")
So immediately it prints: Human Has 2 Eyes. Then the function ends.
Since there is no return, Python does:
return None
So now: x = None
Nothing else is printed yet.
